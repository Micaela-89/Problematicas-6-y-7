            They can also visit unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without masks or distancing so long as the unvaccinated people are not at high risk for severe Covid-19. But they should still wear masks when out in public.

            The UK has yet to make such recommendations, however.

            What are the rules for face coverings?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Face coverings and masks reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, people in the UK are asked to wear them where social distancing is not possible and the virus could easily pass between people - for example on public transport, or in shops.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cutting transmission is important because there is still lots of the virus circulating and many people are yet to be protected by vaccination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exact rules can be seen here for:

            Will we have to keep wearing masks or face coverings?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Once more people have had a vaccine and more is known about how they affect the transmission of Covid, other measures to limit its spread can be reviewed, the government says.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will include the wearing of face masks or coverings.
        </p>
        <p>
            They might still be needed in some circumstances and particularly during winter, however.
        </p>
        <p>
            Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he hopes they would become the norm on public transport as a matter of "personal responsibility".

        <p>
            Pupils in secondary schools in England may be required to wear masks in classrooms, at least until the Easter break.

            Why should I wear a mask?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The main purpose of face coverings is to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself. If everyone wears one, the risk for all goes down.
        </p>
        <p>
            When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth - the main confirmed sources of transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
            They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms.</p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Choose a mask or face covering with a nose wire
            </li>
            <li>
                Check it fits snugly over the mouth, nose and chin
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure it has at least a couple of layers
            </li>
            <li>
                Tie a knot in the ear loops of surgical masks to make a better fit
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The highest level of protection is provided by FFP3 (or similar) masks worn by healthcare workers in high risk settings to safely do their job.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some countries, such as Germany and Austria, medical-grade masks (such as disposable surgical ones) are compulsory on public transport and in shops.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are made from non-woven fabric, which is better at stopping spray and droplets.

            Cloth face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection.

            But the World Health Organization says it has no plans to change its guidance recommending fabric face masks for the general public.
